# Privacy Policy

**Modification Date: M03/D23/Y24 (March 23, 2024)**

This privacy policy will explain what information is collected when you access and make use of this website. This privacy policy will explain the following: the uses of the information, the way we secure and protect such information, who has access to this information, the location where this information is stored, and when the information is collected. This policy applies only to self-hosted services: the main website (thenewoil.org), Lemmy, Matrix, Mastodon, and PeerTube. It does not include external platforms such as (but not limited to) YouTube, Proton, Tuta, Bluesky, and others. Please see those services for their privacy policy. Please note that our blog and shop are not self-hosted. The blog is hosted on Write.As and the shop uses BigCartel & Printful.

## What data is collected, when, and why

### Data auomatically collected

From thenewoil.org
- The geographical location of the user/visitor (based on IP address).
- The visit duration of how long the user/visitor has stayed on the website.
- Which pages were visited
- The OS (operating system) of the user/visitor.
- The browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) of the user/visitor.
- The referrer URL (the website the user came from) of the user/visitor.

From mastodon.thenewoil.org, peertube.thenewoil.org, and nextcloud.thenewoil.org:
- We do not collect any analytics by default from visitors who are not signed in except for view count on PeerTube videos.
- If you sign up for an account, we are able to see all content you post (including DMs with other users) and your email address.
- In the case of Mastodon only, we can also see your IP address. This is retained for 12 months. We would like to shorten this in the future.

### Other data collected

- If you contact us directly - such as emailing us or interacting with our Mastodon or PeerTube instances - we will see some limited information about you such as the content of the message and your email address/Fediverse handle, etc. Please see the privacy policy of the platform you've chosen to contact us on for more information on how they handle your data.

### How we use this data

- To understand how visitors access the site to better optimize the website and services of the hosting provider. (For example, do we have a lot of mobile visitors? What browser engine are people using?)
- To understand how the site is performing (if we are seeing more or less visitors on average, which pages are the most popular, etc).
- To diagnose and debug technical problems and errors.
- To defend & protect the website and services from abuse.

### Who has access to your data

We use 1984 Hosting (1984 ehf) for our hosting service. Therefore both 1984 Hosting and The New Oil Media have access to user data.

The New Oil Media LLC operates on the "Principle of Least Privelege." Moderators on a specific service may have limited access to some of your data depending on what the service allows, but will not have access to other services they don't need access to (such as server logs).

### When is your data shared

The New Oil Media LLC and its members & volunteers will never share any of the data listed above except in the following conditions:

1. The total unique number of visitors on the main website (thenewoil.org) each year is shared in January as part of The New Oil Media, LLC's annual transparency report.
2. Umami Analytics are shared in realtime for the main website (thenewoil.org) [here](https://stats.thenewoil.org/share/jnR7d6tGklwToSOJ/thenewoil.org).
3. The New Oil Media LLC is US based corporation and will comply with any legally binding orders from US law enforcement or government agencies for user data.

## Where is your data stored and how do we protect it

### Where is your data stored

Your data is stored with 1984 Hosting (1984 ehf) which is based in Iceland. We do not control those data centres and therefore do not have control over the physical security of your data.

### How do we protect your data

The New Oil Media LLC attemps to protect the information of its users and visitors as best as possible. We require all volunteers (such as moderators) and employees to use the most modern and up-to-date available security features (e.g. strong, unique passwords and two-step verification/authentication). All servers are hardened in accordance with recommendations from trusted technical advisors and relevant/trusted authorities including government bodies and policymakers. Servers are not encrypted.
