# Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

## What is a Virtual Private Network (VPN)?

**A VPN is an encrypted connection from your device to the VPN provider's server.** All your internet traffic is routed through that server. Additionally, your traffic appears to be coming through that server, which can help to obscure your true IP address.

## Why do I Need a VPN?

You may not, actually. The VPN marketing space is full of snake oil and exaggeration (see the second Warning below). To get a better idea of if a VPN can help address your [threat mode]() and concerns, check out IVPN's "[Do I Need a VPN?](https://www.doineedavpn.com/)" website.

The main reasons I recommend (and use) a VPN is as an added layer of defense. A VPN can offer protection against some types of digital snooping. A common (though unlikely) example is public wifi, which can theoretically be abused to spy on your traffic if the owner of the router is maliciosu or compromised. Even at home, your Internet Service Provider can see your traffic and can legally sell your browsing data to marketers or inject their own ads in some countries. A VPN can also protect your privacy by changing your IP address, which is a piece of identifying information about you online. VPNs also come with peripheral benefits such as the ability to bypass geographic restrictions on content or (in some cases) improve internet speeds.

## What Should I Look For in a VPN Provider?

**The most important thing is to look for a VPN provider who doesn't keep logs.** A provider who logs your activity is no better than your current internet provider in that your traffic can still be sold, censored, or spied on. Unfortunately, "no logs" is a buzzword these days, and numerous providers have been caught lying about this. The best way I've found to verify this claim is to search "[VPN provider] logs" on your privacy-respecting [search engine](/guides/less-important/misc#search-engines) of choice. If the provider has been around for any amount of time and has any positive reputation, you will likely find articles or posts confirming or denying their logging policy in some way. You'll also be alerted to any potential accusations of logging, discussions on that claim, and other information to help you decide if the company is serious or not.

## Warnings

<Highlighting variant="warning">

* Running an VPN server is expensive and requires great technical knowledge. "If a product is free, you are the product." Make sure the company has a viable business plan or else assume they are likely [logging](https://www.howtogeek.com/342731/dont-use-facebooks-onavo-vpn-its-designed-to-spy-on-you/) and [selling your data](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/vpn-and-ad-blocking-apps-sensor-tower), [or worse](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/biggest-risks-using-free-vpns/). Never trust a free VPN unless it's a trial, a limited offering as part of a freemium business model, or in a few extremely rare and well-reputed cases (such as Calyx and Riseup, listed below).

* Many VPN providers engage in highly unethical and misleading marketing. Be careful not to be taken in by fantastical claims of being "anonymous" or "hackerproof." For more information, I recommend Naomi Brockwell's excellent video "[The DARK Side of VPNs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MHBMdTBlok)."

## Honorable Mention: Safing Private Network

<img src="/images/logos/spn.png" alt="spn logo" class="float-left mx-6 w-24" /> VPNs
were never designed for privacy. They were designed to allow employees to
securely connect to the company network to access company resources and
intellectual property while offsite. It's only in the last few decades that
commercial VPNs became widely available to private citizens and were co-opted
for privacy uses. However, this has left a significant number of inadequacies in
their current protections (see [Tips &
Tricks](/guides/less-important/vpns/#tips--tricks) below). The [Safing Private
Network](https://safing.io/spn/) - from Safing, the company behind
[Portmaster](https://safing.io/) - aims to solve these problems. SPN takes a
hybrid approach between a VPN and Tor to achieve to maximum user privacy while
also retaining user-friendliness, speed, and stability. Some features include
giving each connection a different IP address, a multi-hop node architecture,
and the ability to easily split-tunnel apps with the click of a toggle. SPN is
still very new technology and may contain some bugs as the developers work to
mature the product, however early adopters who desire a stronger solution than
traditional VPNs have to offer may wish to look into this option.

## Honorable Mention: Calyx VPN

<img
  src="/images/logos/calyxvpn.png"
  alt="Calyx VPN logo"
  class="float-left mx-6 w-24"
/> [Calyx VPN](https://calyxos.org/docs/guide/apps/calyx-vpn/) is a free
offering from the nonprofit [Calyx Institute](https://calyxinstitute.org/), who
supports the privacy community through a number of initiatives such as a
privacy-respecting [custom operating system](https://calyxos.org/),
[research](https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/privacy-research) initiatives,
[microgrants](https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/microgrants-and-small-project-support),
[educational](https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/education) programs, and a
variety of [digital
services](https://calyxinstitute.org/projects/digital-services) like an XMPP
server, a Jitsi instance, and Tor contributions. Calyx's VPN is free but limited
in scope: you have no choice of server, location, protocol, or any other
advanced features such as split tunneling, custom DNS resolver, or
tracker/malware/ad-blocking. Calyx is a reputable, trustwory organization
offering a reliable and private VPN but we would only recommend it for those who
can't afford a subscription yet still need a VPN.

## Honorable Mention: RiseUp VPN

<img
  src="/images/logos/riseupvpn.png"
  alt="Riseup logo"
  class="float-left mx-6 w-24"
/> Like Calyx VPN, [Riseup](https://riseup.net/en/vpn) is a free offering from
the nonprofit activist group RiseUp Collective. Also like Calyx VPN, it is
extremely limited in scope: you have no choice of server, location, protocol, or
any other advanced features such as split tunneling, custom DNS resolver, or
tracker/malware/ad-blocking. RiseUp offers a reputable, reliable, and private
VPN that should meet the most basic needs for those who need a VPN but have no
budget to spare.

## DNS Leaks & Custom Resolvers

Many of the services I recommend here offer you the opportunity to use a different [DNS resolver](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/advanced/dns-overview/) other than the one offered by the provider. In most cases, I do not recommend this. This is because using a different DNS resolver can cause issues with functionality. Using the same DNS provided by your VPN provider dramatically reduces the likelihood of this happening, while in my experience using an alternate DNS with a VPN dramatically increases the likelihood. Most of the providers I list here use their own DNS resolvers which can optionally block know malware, trackers, ads, and more (in some cases you can even configure this to some extent), therefore you already have a good level of protection from these threats. I do not recommend using a custom DNS resolver unless you are an advanced user who knows what you're doing.

## Tips & Tricks

* I recommend using a VPN on all devices whenever possible. **For mobile devices, this will not hide your real location from your carrier.** It will, however, fool your browser and some apps, and it allows for a secure, encrypted connection - even from your carrier - at all times.

* **Please note that a VPN is not anonymous.** Many companies will advertise that using a VPN will make you invisible to various potential snoops, but VPN protections can be defeated in a variety of ways and do not protect against other advanced tracking features like cookies and browser fingerprinting. VPNs do exactly two things: they change your IP address and they create an encrypted tunnel. They will not block trackers or malware (though some providers employ DNS-based blocking to mitigate some - but not all - of these risks), they will not make you anonymous, and they will not speed up your connection. In some cases they can help with unblocking content that is restricted based on your location because of the changed IP address, but true anonymity is difficult and complicated to achieve online depending on your activites and goals. Please see my notes about the [Tor Browser](/guides/most-important/browser#tor-browser) for more information on this.

* Some additional tools for vetting a VPN you're considering or learning more about VPNs in general include Techlore's [VPN Toolkit](https://techlore.tech/vpn) and Windscribe's [VPN Relationship Map](https://windscribe.com/vpnmap).
