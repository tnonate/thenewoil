# Password Managers

## What is a Password Manager?

A password manager is a program or service that allows you to store website login information such as username, password, and other data in a secure format (called a "vault"). Your vault is encrypted in such a way that nobody can access it except for you.

A password manager can also be used to generate secure passwords (so that you don't have to come up with them yourself) and to autofill the login fields on a website, which can be a helpful line of defense against [phishing](http://localhost:4321/en/guides/less-important/misc#phishing--clicking-links) attacks.

## Why do I Need a Password Manager?

**The single most important thing you can do to protect your accounts is to use strong passwords that are not reused anywhere.** Weak passwords can be [easily guessed](https://www.euronews.com/next/2024/05/11/how-long-does-it-take-a-hacker-to-crack-a-password-in-2024) using off-the-shelf computers, usually in a matter of minutes or seconds. Even a strong password reused across multiple services can be unsafe since some companies don't use [proper](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/misconfigured-firebase-instances-leaked-19-million-plaintext-passwords/) [measures](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/27/meta-fined-101-5m-for-2019-breach-that-exposed-hundreds-of-millions-of-facebook-passwords/) in securing your passwords on their side.

Using a strong password on each service will make your accounts practically impossible to hack by most [common methods](https://www.keepersecurity.com/blog/2023/10/31/compromised-online-account-what-it-is-and-how-to-prevent-it/). **A [strong password](https://protonmail.com/blog/how-long-should-my-password-be/) should consist of sixteen or more characters consisting of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters, and should not be reused on any other accounts.**

Of course, this means that it's unrealistic to remember all your passwords, so the solution is to use a password manager. By using a password manager, you only ever have to remember a single password: the master password to login.

## What Should I Look For in a Password Manager?

**The most important thing is to look for a service that is "[zero knowledge](/guides/prologue/encryption)".** (This is also sometimes called "zero access" or "end-to-end encryption.") This means that no employee of the company can see your passwords and information.

_Remember: if the provider's employees can see your data, so can a criminal who gains access._

Note that end-to-end encryption is not the same as regular encryption. Don't be fooled by companies who only say "encrypted" or "military-grade encryption." Make sure they are end-to-end encrypted.

**You should also consider whether or not cloud-based services are right for you.** Cloud-based services offer conveniences like synchronization between devices, but you also run the risk that a successful criminal will download your database and then have unlimited opportunities to find weaknesses in the encryption (see the LastPass warning below). On the other hand, locally-stored databases are safer from a data breach but run the risk of getting deleted, lost, or corrupted if you don't keep reliable backups.

## Avoid The Following

<Highlighting variant="warning">

- **LastPass** is a popular password manager, but they've been riddled with security issues and questionable business decisions for years. This includes things like [limiting free users](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family) to choose between only using their account on either mobile or desktop devices (not both) or a string of data breaches, often exposing user master passwords. The most notable incident and final straw for most was a [massive 2022 data breach](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2023/03/03/why-you-should-stop-using-lastpass-after-new-hack-method-update/?sh=a6ff8a828fc9), which they announced on December 23 (the Friday before Christmas, knowing that most people would be out of office or busy for the next few days and unlikely to see the disclosure) where they attempted to downplay the issue as a minor incident. It would later come to light that many users had their vaults stolen by the attackers, allowing the attackers to attempt to decrypt them at their leisure with the company powerless to do anything in response. Furthermore, a large amount of users' vaults were unencrypted (such as the sign-in link for the website, allowing attackers to craft more convincing phishing emails), users' master passwords were poorly hashed (making them easier to crack), and the breach had all been a result of poor internal security practices. Authorities would later go on to directly tie over $150 million worth of thefts directly to this [breach](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/03/feds-link-150m-cyberheist-to-2022-lastpass-hacks/), which are still [ongoing](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cryptocurrency-theft-attacks-traced-to-2022-lastpass-breach/). LasPass has proven themselves untrustworthy in their treatment of customers and their data. Even if you don't go with one of the password managers I recommend here, I _strongly urge_ you to avoid LastPass.

1Password does not qualify for a full endorsement on this site because they do not have [source-available](/guides/prologue/open-source) <dfn title="software that resides on the user's device, aka apps, programs, etc">clients</dfn>. However 1Password's security is praised by experts, they have been [audited](https://support.1password.com/security-assessments/), they have a long and positive track record, and they even support a variety of open source initiatives. 1Password would not be my first recommendation for most users because other equally good, free, and source-available alternatives exist (such as the ones listed above), but if none of the recommended offerings appeal to you for any reason, 1Password is also a highly reputable option. (Note that 1Password does not offer a free tier.)

## Passkeys

Since 2023, we have seen a rapid release and adoption of a new technology called "passkeys." I won't spend time here explaining how they work because it is somewhat lengthy and complicated, but if you're interested there's an excellent write-up [here](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/passwordless-google-accounts-are-easier-and-more-secure-than-passwords-heres-why/). Whether or not you should use passkeys depends on several factors. For a more comprehensive explanation, I suggest checking out EFF's [deep dive](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/10/passkeys-and-privacy) into passkeys, but here's the basic summary:

### When _to_ use passkeys

- If you're not currently using a password manager<sup>(1)</sup>
- If you're currently re-using passwords (regardless if they're good or not)
- If you're not using a [security token](/guides/most-important/mfa#honorable-mention-security-tokens) for multifactor authentication

### When _not_ to use passkeys

- If you're currently using a [security token](/guides/most-important/mfa#honorable-mention-security-tokens) for multifactor authentication
- If you have a high [threat model](/guides/prologue/threat-model) where even a small mistake could be catastrophic

_1: You will still need to pick and use a password manager to take advantage of passkeys (see the next section on why)_

If you want to see which services currently support passkeys, you can check 1Password's [Passkey Directory](https://passkeys.directory/) or Bitwarden's [Passkey Index](https://passkeyindex.io/).

Some [security tokens](/guides/most-important/mfa#honorable-mention-security-tokens) allow you to save passkeys on them instead of in a password manager. This is the strongest level of account security currently available at this time. However, be aware that right now none of these manufacturers offer a way to export your passkeys from the device, meaning there is no backup possible if your device is lost, stolen, damaged, or you simply wish to move to a new one. Be sure to keep a backup security key with a second passkey saved if you go this route.

## Storing Passwords & Passkeys in the Browser & Apple Keychain

It's common for people to store passwords (and now passkeys) within the browser when prompted or to use native, on-device options like Apple's Keychain. **I don't recommend using the browser's built-in password manager.** For the browser specifically, <dfn title="malicious software, aka viruses">malware</dfn> exists that is capable of stealing browser data including history, passwords, credit cards, addresses, and more.

I also find using a third-party password manager to be a better overall experience, with better apps and more flexibility to use whatever device you wish or switch at any time (such as using an iPhone with a Windows computer or going from iPhone to Android).

## Getting Started

A good first step is to import your current passwords from wherever you have them saved (Chrome, Apple Keychain, etc) into your new password manager of choice and then wipe them from the old location. Most password managers have support pages that explain how to import your existing passwords from wherever you may be currently storing them. 

After that, I suggest you **stop what you're doing immediately and change the passwords for your most critical accounts to something secure.** This means bank, email, doctor's office, and other accounts you can't afford to live without.

For the rest of your accounts, I suggest updating your passwords to something secure "as you go." For example, next time you log into eBay, change your password. Then, next time you order pizza, change that password. In time, every account will have a strong password without the time and stress of changing them all at once.

## Tips & Tricks

Contrary to what you may have heard, **writing down your master password (or other important passwords) isn't always a bad idea, with some caveats.** First, ensure you store it somewhere safe where criminals or other adversaries are unlikely to find it (in other words: not as a sticky note on your monitor. Consider a small notebook or a card in your wallet instead). Second, don't make it super obvious that it's your password (for example, by writing "PC password: [password]" on said paper or notebook). Writing down a password can be a great way to create a backup and storing it offline nearly eliminates the risk of compromise (at least from certain attacks), however you must be mindful not to lose the written-down password and to protect it from any physical threats such as burglars or fires.

For your master login password, I recommend you use a passphrase so that it's easy to remember but still secure. A passphrase is a series of words rather than a single word or a string of random gibberish. A good passphrase should be at least five random words, so try to avoid famous quotes or obvious words like a list of your children's names. One common resource for generating a good passphrase is EFF's [Dice-Generated Passphrases](https://www.eff.org/dice). You could also Bitwarden's [free password generator](https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/). A [good passphrase](https://www.useapassphrase.com/) can take hundreds of years (or more) for even high-end computers to [guess](/guides/prologue/data-breaches/).

Make sure you enable [two-factor authentication](/guides/most-important/mfa) on your password vault - the stronger the better. If you can afford it, I recommend using a [security token](/guides/most-important/mfa#honorable-mention-security-tokens) here even if you don't use it elsewhere (though I recommend using it wherever possible). Your password vault will contain access to every part of your life, so it's vital to put the strongest level of protection on it.

Some password managers also allow you to use them to store your 2FA seeds. This can be convenient, but it does create a single point of failure. If you choose to go this route, be sure to use the highest level of security available on your password manager, ideally a strong passphrase with a [security token](/guides/most-important/mfa#honorable-mention-security-tokens).

A major feature of password managers is the ability to store a login URL or link. I strongly recommend making use of this feature, as it can also help to protect you against [phishing](/guides/less-important/misc/#phishing--clicking-links) attacks. The autofill feature will only work on the site you enter into the login URL field of your password manager. If a site doesn't autofill, that's not always a smoking gun but double check that it's legitimate before loging in anyways. 

Password managers typically include a note-taking section. This is a great spot to take notes like MFA backup codes, answers to security questions, or other account-specific details you want to remember. However, beware that this creates a single point of failure for each account, so ensure that you're applying maximum protection to your password manager in this case.

A good strategy for added account security is to give false answers to security questions. For example, a common security question is "what is your father's middle name?" This kind of information is usually [easy to find online](/guides/moderately-important/people-search/) due to the increasingly digital nature of everything. Instead of the true answer, answer with a randomly generated word and record it in the notes section.
