# Securing Your Browser

## Why Should I Change my Browser?

Currently **Google Chrome has the most users, but it's [basically spyware](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/)**, even going so far as to [turn on your microphone and eavesdrop on you while you browse](https://www.hackread.com/google-chromium-browser-listens-conversations/). Instead, you can get almost identical performance and security with a massive improvement in privacy by switching to [Brave](https://brave.com/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). Changing browsers may take some getting used to at first, but is critical for improving your privacy.

## Brave vs Firefox

Browsers are highly controversial. No matter what browsers I suggest, people will always say that I should've considered a different one or shouldn't have listed one I did. To see my criteria for why I selected these browers to list, check [here](/criteria#web-browsers). In the interest of transparency, I do want to acknowledge that **both Brave and Mozilla have made questionable decisions.** Brave's criticisms mostly revolve around their use of BAT, a cryptocurrency they developed to allow site owners and content creators to get paid based on visits and time spent on their site. You can read more about that [here](https://brave.com/brave-rewards/). Such criticisms included [collecting payments on behalf of creators without consent](https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/cryptocurrency-news/spotlight/famous-youtuber-tom-scott-frustrated-with-brave/), [injecting affiliate links into browser traffic so Brave made more money](https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/brave-privacy-browser-caught-automatically-adding-affiliate-links-to-cryptocurrency-urls/), and [installing software without transparency](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/20/23925192/brave-browser-vpn-windows-11). These situations have since been corrected. For Mozilla's shortcomings, they regularly draw criticism for having [poor default settings](https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-back-its-firefoxs-default-search-engine-again-after-mozilla-ends-yahoo-deal/), having a [hostile attitude toward users](https://blog.privacyguides.org/2024/07/14/mozilla-disappoints-us-yet-again-2/#lack-of-consent), paying their CEO over $3 million USD per year while [struggling to be financially solvent](https://www.zdnet.com/article/endangered-firefox-the-state-of-mozilla/), and just a general lack of clear direction as a company.

While I don't think there is a perfect solution in this space, *I personally recommend Brave for most people.* It is the most Chrome-like so most users will find the transition easy and have the fewest issues with website breakage. It's also extremely privacy-friendly "out of the box" without having to make a lot of adjustments, including the built-in ad-blocker. Having said that, a lot of people feel very strongly about Brave as a company, the BAT token, and the idea of giving Google too much power by having too many users dependent on the Chromium engine. Therefore, I will leave it up to my readers to decide which company they consider to be more ethical and which browser is right for their needs.

## Extensions

**If you decide to go with Brave, you don't need to add any additional extensions** (except, optionally, Snowflake. See the next paragraph for more information). **If you decide to go with Firefox, you should install [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/)**, a powerful, lightweight ad- and tracker-blocker. Malicious, fake ads designed to scam you or trick you into downloading malware (called "malvertising") have become such a serious problem that even the FBI [recommends](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/22/fbi-ad-blocker/) that you use an ad-blocker. Additionally, the online advertising model has become one of the most [prolific](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/online-behavioral-ads-fuel-surveillance-industry-heres-how) and invisible privacy threats out there. Officially, uBlock Origin is ready for use "out of the box." You can choose to enable more filters if you'd like, but be aware that some suggest this could make you stand out to trackers online.

<Highlighting variant="warning">
[According the developer](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), uBlock Origin should not be used in conjuction with any other content blockers like Privacy Badger, Ghostery, AdBlock Plus, or others.

There are two additional extensions that I think are worth adding if you feel so inclined. The first is your [password manager's](/guides/most-important/passwords) official extension. Many password managers offer browser extensions to help make logging in easy and safe. There are numerous advantages to these, like protection against phishing and keyloggers, and as such I consider these okay to install if you want to. The other is [Snowflake](https://snowflake.torproject.org/) (this is optionally included in Brave, see the recommended settings below). This is a project to help certain internet users in foreign, repressive countries bypass censorship. This should not cause any kind of legal risk to you. Both of these extensions are optional, but I believe they are safe to use.

**I strongly advise against installing any other extensions unless absolutely necessary.** The more extensions you install, the more easily your browser can be fingerprinted, making it easier to track you across the web despite any other privacy-enhancing changes you make to your browser or browsing habits. They also present a serious [security risk](https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-issue-chrome-extensions-access-private.html) as extensions typically have advanced privileges that allow them to modify the web page, read data, and other necessary functions that could be abused for malicious purposes.

## Honorable Mentions

### Mullvad Browser

<img
  src="/images/logos/mullvad-browser.png"
  alt="mullvad browser logo"
  class="float-left mx-6 w-24"
/>
While the [Mullvad Browser](https://mullvad.net/en/browser) technically meets
the criteria to be listed as an official recommendation here, I list it as an
"honorable mention" for one reason: usability. The Mullvad Browser is the result
of a collaboration between [Mullvad VPN](/guides/less-important/vpns) and [The
Tor Project](###Tor-Browser) and is ultimately based on Firefox. The Mullvad
Browser is basically "[the Tor
Browser](/guides/most-important/browser/#tor-browser) without Tor." It attempts
to make all users look the same by applying the same settings to every user,
thus defeating browser fingerprinting (please note it is recommended to use
Mullvad Browser with a [VPN](/guides/less-important/vpns/)). Furthermore, the Mullvad Browser offers a number of
"hardening" [features](https://mullvad.net/en/browser/hard-facts) that make it
more private and secure than regular Firefox. However, these changes may come at
the cost of some possible site breakage from time to time, including breaking
certain security features that I encourage (like the use of [hardware security
tokens](/guides/most-important/mfa/), for example). I strongly recommend Mullvad
Browser as a daily browser - in most cases, it will work excellently with few
issues - however my advice to keep a backup browser (at the bottom of this
page) is particularly salient if you choose to do so.{" "}

### Tor Browser

<img src="/images/logos/tor.png" alt="tor logo" class="float-left mx-6 w-24" />
Between the extensions and the settings changes suggested on this page, you will
greatly reduce the ability of websites to track you as you go from site to site.
However, it should be noted that browser fingerprinting - one of the most common
forms of online tracking - is incredibly complex and ever evolving. While these
changes have dramatically reduced your fingerprint, you should not assume - as
with any of the advice I give on this site - that you are totally invisible or
untrackable. If you want to achieve maximum privacy and/or anonymity, consider
using the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download).

The Tor browser is a somewhat common daily browser among privacy enthusiasts for a few reasons. If you're unfamiliar with Tor, check out my [Tor Crash Course](https://apertatube.net/w/84BiWbkzvDFHfv4QkaiTSu) video. In a nutshell, the Tor Browser is a hardened version of Firefox with a number of changes that make it extra resilient against tracking. It attempts to make everyone look the same, thus making tracking harder. It further accomplishes this by routing all your traffic through several relays before arriving at the destination website. All these changes add up to make Tor users as anonymous as possible in the modern era, with a few caveats. **Using the Tor Browser as your main browser is a great idea,** but keep in mind that many legitimate websites such as banking and e-commerce sites block known Tor addresses to prevent abuse and fraud, so **you'll want to keep a backup browser installed** for when that happens. Note that using the Tor Browser in a truly, 100% anonymous way is incredibly difficult and requires very intentional browsing habits, so don't do anything illegal. Finally, because all nodes are volunteer-run and therefore work on an "honor system," be sure to check that any site you login or transfer personal data across is using HTTPS (the lock icon at the beginning of the address bar) and is the actual site and not a fake phishing site designed to look like the real thing.

If you're still unsure what browser is right for you, [Privacy Tests](https://privacytests.org/) and [Cookie Status](https://www.cookiestatus.com/) compare a few of the more popular choices.

**I recommend keeping both recommended browsers and using the opposite one as a backup.** For example, if you decide to use Brave, I would keep Firefox as a backup and vice versa. In many cases a website that experiences issues in one browser is likely to work in the other since they use different rendering engines. Even if you dislike the company behind the other browser and don't plan to use it as your "daily driver," it's still wise in my experience to have it available as a fallback. More often than not, it works.
