\*These sources have a notable political bias, which you can see by hovering over the title. I still consider them great sources of information, however be warned that they tend to inject a considerable amount of personal political opinion into their work. (_Note: these labels are applied using the American political spectrum, your opinion of them may vary based on your own political climate and beliefs._)

## Get Involved

The best way to support privacy and security is to contribute to the projects that you use and get value from, either financially via donations or paid plans, or by helping contribute bug reports, suggestions, code fixes, and just generally spreading the word. You can also support "the cause" by getting involved with a local digital rights group and contacting your political representatives about proposed legislation (see the [US State Privacy Legislation Tracker](https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/)). The following are some of non-profits we recommend who fight for privacy legislation and policies at a collective level.
