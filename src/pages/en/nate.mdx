Nate Bartram is the founder and editor-in-chief of The New Oil. He began his privacy journey in 2016. Nate is self-taught and created The New Oil without any traditional marketing or investment except his own time and money. Since it's inception in 2018, The New Oil has grown to have nearly 200,000 annual visitors. Thanks to community feedback, the site has continued to stay current and offer advice on emerging technologies and threats like passkeys and people search sites. It has also expanded to offer video content, a blog, a daily news feed, and a podcast. This influx of attention and reputation has also allowed Nate to sharpen his own knowledge. The funding from The New Oil has allowed Nate to purchase and review various tools and services, as well as to invest in educational materials to further his own technical understanding of the privacy space. Additionally, Nate's rise to prominence has allowed him to personally connect with various projects and the teams behind them to get more insight into how they work. You can see some of the various places Nate has shared his expertise, including news articles, podcasts, and conferences.

## Hire Nate

In a former life, Nate was a freelance audio engineer, musician, and - at one time - a manager for unsigned bands. Nate's specialty was live sound and his work ranged from conferences and conventions to concerts and theatre. These days, with The New Oil's content creation, Nate has transitioned into a more studio role, focused on editing video and audio for both The New Oil's channel and also Surveillance Report, his weekly podcast co-hosted with Techlore. In addition to being available for [consulting](/consulting), you can hire Nate to help edit your own audio or video content, or to speak at your event, on your podcast, or whatever else you think can help further the message of privacy. You can see examples of Nate's latest work on both channels linked below, and contact him at the email addresses at the bottom of the page.
